CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS VISUALIZER 

The launch of my new project - a CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer! 
This tool allows you to see in real-time how different scheduling algorithms work by simulating the execution of multiple processes and displaying their behavior on a graph. With this visualizer, you can learn about popular scheduling algorithms like Round Robin, Shortest Job First,and many more.You can experiment with different parameters like time quantum, priority levels, and burst time to see how they affect the overall performance of the system.If you're interested in learning more or contributing to the project,check out the link below and feel free to share your feedback or suggestions.
